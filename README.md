# 🛠️ Brokkr Engine

**Brokkr Engine** is a lightweight, event-driven 2D game engine written in C++ with Lua scripting support. Designed as a personal learning project, it emphasizes clean engine architecture, scripting flexibility, and performance-conscious design.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Entity-Component-System (ECS)** architecture for modularity and performance
- **Lua scripting integration** for in-game logic, events, and behaviors
- **Event-driven messaging system** to decouple systems cleanly
- **Tiled map editor integration** for streamlined level design
- **zlib compression** for compressed asset bundles and runtime memory efficiency
- **Custom file and folder tooling** to simplify asset and project management

---

## 🎯 Goals

Brokkr is more than just a toy engine — it's a sandbox for exploring:
- Data-oriented design patterns
- Runtime performance strategies
- Game tool development and automation
- Clean engine-layer separation and modularity

---

## 🧪 What I Learned

- How to architect a small but scalable engine core
- The balance between flexibility (Lua) and performance (C++)
- How to decouple gameplay systems using event messaging
- Real-world challenges of asset loading, level editing, and scripting integration
